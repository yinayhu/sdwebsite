        <h2>Why Be A Judge?</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>use this section to convince a parent to judge! 

talk about how important parent judges because they run the whole tournament and if there aren’t enough judges we have to start dropping people

talk about how it helps their kid secure a spot in tournaments and they get priority for not being dropped

even talk about how judging is beneficial for the parent itself--you get to watch other students compete, get to train your own skills, get to be there to support your kid at tournaments

judges get free food, maybe we should create more incentives??
